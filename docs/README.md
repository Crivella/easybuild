# Old location of sources for EasyBuild docs

The sources for the [EasyBuild documentation](https://docs.easybuild.io) used to be located here
(in reStructuredText format, rendered using Sphinx).

Now they are located at <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-docs> (in MarkDown format, rendered using
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material)).
